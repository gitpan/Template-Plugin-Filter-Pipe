DESCRIPTION
    This Template Toolkit filter plugin is an adapter for Text::Pipe. The
    default filter name is "pipe", but you can override this with the "USE"
    directive.

    When using the filter, you need to pass the name of the pipe segment you
    would like to create, and optionally named arguments to be passed to the
    pipe.

    See Text::Pipe and its derived distributions for more detail on which
    pipe segments are available and which arguments they take.
